## Core CS knowledge

This repository contains C++ code showcasing my knowledge of core CS concepts and alorithms. Here you can find my implementation of integral sorting and search algorithms as well as a demostration of concepts such as bit manipulation, recursion, dynamic programming, memeory management

## Data Structures
- **Array**
- **Linked List**

Trees

    Trees - Notes & Background
    Binary search trees: BSTs
    Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap
    balanced search trees (general concept, not details)
    traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS, DFS

Graphs

    directed
    undirected
    adjacency matrix
    adjacency list
    traversals: BFS, DFS
