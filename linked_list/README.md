<details><summary><strong>Operations</strong></summary><br>

- at(index) - returns item at given index
- insert(index, value) - insert value at index
- delete(index) - delete item at index
- reverse() - reverses the list
- front() - get value of front item
- push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
- pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
- back() - get value of end item
- push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
- pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
